## Top Must-Read Publications

### 1. Standardized brain and plasma EV enrichment pipeline validated for Single sample multi-Omic and fatty acids applications in Mouse and Human

**Source:** bioRxiv (all)

**Published:** 2026-01-24T00:00:00

**Final Score:** 34/100 (Confidence: medium)

**Individual Scores:** Claude: 28, Gemini: 40

**Agreement:** moderate

**Summary:** The publication presents a method for characterizing extracellular vesicles, which may have future implications for cancer biomarker discovery. However, it does not directly address early cancer detection or specific cancer types, limiting its relevance to SpotItEarly's mission.

**Why Relevant:** While both reviews acknowledge the lack of direct cancer detection applications, Gemini's review highlights the potential for future biomarker discovery, which is relevant to SpotItEarly's mission. However, the absence of specific cancer-related applications leads to a low overall relevance score.

### 2. A Systems-Level Transcriptomic Analysis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome as a Mitochondrial-Immunometabolic Disorder

**Source:** bioRxiv (all)

**Published:** 2026-01-24T00:00:00

**Final Score:** 5/100 (Confidence: high)

**Individual Scores:** Claude: 5, Gemini: 10

**Agreement:** high

**Summary:** The publication presents a systems-level analysis of PCOS, identifying mechanisms unrelated to cancer. It lacks any connection to early cancer detection or relevant methodologies, confirming its irrelevance to SpotItEarly's mission.

**Why Relevant:** Both reviews clearly indicate that the publication does not address cancer detection or early screening methods, focusing instead on a non-cancerous disorder (PCOS). The computational nature of the study further emphasizes its lack of relevance to SpotItEarly's mission.

### 3. Privacy Vulnerabilities in Synthetic Single-Cell RNA-Sequence Data

**Source:** bioRxiv (all)

**Published:** 2026-01-24T00:00:00

**Final Score:** 5/100 (Confidence: high)

**Individual Scores:** Claude: 5, Gemini: 15

**Agreement:** high

**Summary:** The publication presents a study on privacy vulnerabilities in synthetic single-cell RNA-sequence data generation, with no relevance to cancer detection or early screening applications. It lacks any clinical application or novel detection methodologies pertinent to SpotItEarly's goals.

**Why Relevant:** Both reviewers agree that the publication does not address early cancer detection or related methodologies. The focus is solely on privacy vulnerabilities in synthetic data generation, which is orthogonal to SpotItEarly's mission.

### 4. A Spinal Muscular Atrophy Model Reveals Both Developmental and Degenerative Neuronal Defects in C. elegans

**Source:** bioRxiv (all)

**Published:** 2026-01-24T00:00:00

**Final Score:** 0/100 (Confidence: high)

**Individual Scores:** Claude: 0, Gemini: 0

**Agreement:** high

**Summary:** The publication investigates mechanisms of neuronal degeneration in spinal muscular atrophy using C. elegans models. It does not address any aspects of cancer detection or screening, making it irrelevant to SpotItEarly's mission.

**Why Relevant:** Both reviews unanimously concluded that the publication is irrelevant to cancer detection, focusing instead on spinal muscular atrophy, a non-cancerous condition. The methodologies discussed, while scientifically valid, do not contribute to SpotItEarly's mission of early cancer detection.

### 5. Inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier attenuates the integrated stress response activation in a cellular model of Huntington's disease

**Source:** bioRxiv (all)

**Published:** 2026-01-24T00:00:00

**Final Score:** 0/100 (Confidence: high)

**Individual Scores:** Claude: 0, Gemini: 0

**Agreement:** high

**Summary:** The publication investigates mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition in a model of Huntington's disease, demonstrating no relevance to cancer biology or early detection methodologies. Therefore, it is not aligned with SpotItEarly's mission.

**Why Relevant:** Both reviews unanimously agree that the publication focuses on Huntington's disease, which is unrelated to cancer detection or diagnosis. The research does not contribute to SpotItEarly's mission of early cancer detection.
