title,rank,explanation
GRAIL and the quest for earlier multi-cancer detection,85,"Not ticking all the boxes, but the fact it is coming from Grail and that it has an overview over the industry makes it highly relevant"
Estimating the population health impact of a multi-cancer early detection genomic blood test to complement existing screening in the US and UK,85,"Not ticking all the boxes, but the fact it is coming from grail and that it has an overview over the industry makes it highly relevant"
Advances in the early detection of lung cancer using analysis of volatile organic compounds: from imaging to sensors.,85,"Although the results are weak, and this is not a prime publisher/sponsor, the topic is relevant enough to make it highly relevant"
A Cell-free DNA Blood-Based Test for Colorectal Cancer Screening,95,
Feasibility of integrating canine olfaction with chemical and microbial profiling of urine to detect lethal prostate cancer,85,"Although published on an archive journal with no peer review, the topic and the research is important enough"
Multi-cancer early detection tests for general population screening: a systematic literature review,90,"Though a Systematic review, covering the whole MCED industry is highly relevant"
Blood-based tests for multicancer early detection (PATHFINDER): a prospective cohort study,90,
Canine olfaction combined with Bayesian modeling for multi-cancer detection from breath samples: a Phase-2 study in India,85,"Though highly relevant, the fact that it is not peer reviewed lower the relevancy"
Screening for gastric cancer using exhaled breath samples,90,Strong Double blind study
Improved Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Bladder Cancer with an Electronic Nose: A Large Pilot Study,90,"Highly relevant, but unknown sponsor and publisher, lower the relevancy a bit"
Multicancer Detection Tests for Screening : A Systematic Review,80,The inconclusive results make it a bit less relevant
